# Filtering-signal
Adaptive Noise Cancellation refers to the application of Adaptive filtering
algorithms to noise cancellation. Noise cancellation in signal processing means
removal of unwanted noise or unwanted frequencies from the signal. Active
Noise Cancellation makes use of Adaptive Filtering, which is a filtering method
that looks at sampling audio waves analysing the input audio for noise and then
produces a destructive wave of the same frequency and amplitude as the noise
present in the audio wave which results in cancellation of the noise. We
implement three algorithms - 
-> Least Mean Squares (LMS), Normalized Least
-> Mean Squares (NLMS) and 
-> Recursive Least Squares (RLS). 
We compare the
performance of the three adaptive filters. We designed a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) using Matlab where we plot various graphs for showing the
transition of the input audio from an unfiltered noisy signal to a filtered signal.
